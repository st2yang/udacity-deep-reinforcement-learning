## Table of Contents

### Exercises

The exercises lead us through implementing various algorithms in reinforcement learning.

* [Monte Carlo](https://github.com/st2yang/udacity-deep-reinforcement-learning/tree/master/1.%20Introduction%20to%20Deep%20Reinforcement%20Learning/monte-carlo): Implement Monte Carlo methods for prediction and control. 
* [Temporal-Difference](https://github.com/st2yang/udacity-deep-reinforcement-learning/tree/master/1.%20Introduction%20to%20Deep%20Reinforcement%20Learning/temporal-difference): Implement Temporal-Difference methods such as Sarsa, Q-Learning, and Expected Sarsa. 
* [The Taxi Problem](https://github.com/st2yang/udacity-deep-reinforcement-learning/tree/master/1.%20Introduction%20to%20Deep%20Reinforcement%20Learning/lab-taxi): In this lab, we train a taxi to pick up and drop off passengers.

### Projects

The projects can be found below.  All of the projects use rich simulation environments from [Unity ML-Agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents).

* [Navigation](https://github.com/st2yang/udacity-deep-reinforcement-learning/tree/master/Project1%20-%20Navigation): In the first project, we train an agent to collect yellow bananas while avoiding blue bananas.
* [Continuous Control](https://github.com/st2yang/udacity-deep-reinforcement-learning/tree/master/Project2%20-%20Continuous%20Control): In the second project, we train a robotic arm to reach target locations.
* [Collaboration and Competition](https://github.com/st2yang/udacity-deep-reinforcement-learning/tree/master/Project3%20-%20Collaboration%20and%20Competition): In the third project, we train a pair of agents to play tennis.
