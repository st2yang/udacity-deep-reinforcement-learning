# Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree

![Trained Agents][image1]

This repository contains my solutions to exercises and projects of Udacity's [Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893) program.  

## Table of Contents

### Exercises

The exercises lead us through implementing various algorithms in reinforcement learning.

* [Monte Carlo](https://github.com/st2yang/udacity-deep-reinforcement-learning/tree/master/1.%20Introduction%20to%20Deep%20Reinforcement%20Learning/monte-carlo): Implement Monte Carlo methods for prediction and control. 
* [Temporal-Difference](https://github.com/st2yang/udacity-deep-reinforcement-learning/tree/master/1.%20Introduction%20to%20Deep%20Reinforcement%20Learning/temporal-difference): Implement Temporal-Difference methods such as Sarsa, Q-Learning, and Expected Sarsa. 
* [The Taxi Problem](https://github.com/st2yang/udacity-deep-reinforcement-learning/tree/master/1.%20Introduction%20to%20Deep%20Reinforcement%20Learning/lab-taxi): In this lab, we train a taxi to pick up and drop off passengers.
* [Discretization](https://github.com/st2yang/udacity-deep-reinforcement-learning/tree/master/1.%20Introduction%20to%20Deep%20Reinforcement%20Learning/discretization): Learn how to discretize continuous state spaces, and solve the Mountain Car environment.
* [Tile Coding](https://github.com/st2yang/udacity-deep-reinforcement-learning/tree/master/1.%20Introduction%20to%20Deep%20Reinforcement%20Learning/tile-coding): Implement a method for discretizing continuous state spaces that enables better generalization.
* [Deep Q-Network](https://github.com/st2yang/udacity-deep-reinforcement-learning/tree/master/2.%20Value-Based%20Methods/dqn): Explore how to use a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to navigate a space vehicle without crashing.

### Projects

The projects can be found below.  All of the projects use rich simulation environments from [Unity ML-Agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents).

* [Navigation](https://github.com/st2yang/udacity-deep-reinforcement-learning/tree/master/Project1%20-%20Navigation): In the first project, we train an agent to collect yellow bananas while avoiding blue bananas.
